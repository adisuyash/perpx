# PerpX

PerpX is a decentralized perpetual exchange on EDU Chain that aims to create synthetic assets that mimic the price of another asset without ever holding the actual asset. <br>
This innovation allows users to gain exposure to various assets without the need to physically own them, providing a seamless and efficient way to diversify and manage investments.

#### Live Deployment on Vercel: https://PerpX.vercel.app

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

### Frontend

The frontend source code is in the `frontend` folder in our GitHub repository. This section handles the user interface and interactions, providing a smooth and intuitive experience for users.

#### Folder Structure

```
/frontend
  ├── public
  ├── src
  ├── package.json

```

### Backend

The backend code, which handles PerpX's core logic and data processing, is hosted on the BetterIDEA. The current file is provided in the `backend` folder in our GitHub repository.
